  "String1": "App to add streaming tv shows and movies Tiles for Windows 10",
  "String2": "I developed this application years ago when Windows 10 had Tiles, for those of you who use that version of the operating system the app will still work for you. Although the app is paid, you can use the app for free by downloading the source code and with Visual Studio installed. I also point out that the app only works in the United States, Canada and the countries of the European Union due to an absurd rule of the Microsoft Store.",
  "String3": "Below I detail how it works:",
  "String4": "Search by Platform",
  "String5": "Before adding a Tile to the Start menu, the app can search for a series or movie available on the selected platform.",
  "String6": "Movie/series selection",
  "String7": "Because many movies and series are parts of large franchises, the app also shows results related to your search.",
  "String8": "Tiles Customization",
  "String9": "Although the app will load default images of the series or movie for the Tile, the user can change them at will or even modify which movie the Tile will run.",
  "String10": "How it appears in Windows 10",
  "String11": "You can add several Tiles and the final result depends on you.",
  "String12": "Also Compatible with Windows 11",
  "String13": "The app also works on Windows 11, but it is only capable of adding an icon to the Start menu unfortunately."
