  "String1": "I could do like most websites and put a huge text only understandable for lawyers and AIs, but I will try to summarize the privacy policy that I have on this website, apps that I develop or even games:",
  "String2": "For my part, I do not collect any data that you make use of any of my work, in fact you can see the source code in case you have questions.",
  "String3": "But I can't prevent third parties from collecting data, for example, if I upload a game to Steam, Valve will collect data about the game and your use of it.",
  "String4": "In the case of pepeizqdeals.com I only store the users who log in. Each user can consult the stored data within their account and can delete their account if they consider it necessary.",
  "String5": "In all my projects I do not use Google Analytics or similar services, I do not even use ads for a financing model.",
  "String6": "Personally, I think that data collection on the Internet has gotten out of hand thanks to the impunity that large companies enjoy. I am aware that a single developer is not going to change things, but at least I try to be honest with my work."
