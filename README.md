This is the source code of the website [pepeizqapps.com](https://pepeizqapps.com/). It has been developed with ASP.NET Core 8 and .NET 8.0 with the C# programming language. I no longer update this version of the project, I have switched to a fully Blazor-based version.

> [!NOTE]
> For security reasons I do not include the database in the source code, nor the files appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json (these files connect to the database).
